FirstHand
=========

The FirstHand project is all about addressing the need for a smarter, more flexible astronaut's glove. The current space glove presents many challenges, including comfort, hand injuries, and the ability to receive input and provide feedback.

At its core, FirstHand is a sophisticated thermostat for your hand. It uses small temperature sensors and heating/cooling elements for each finger to provide essential temperature control for astronauts. The feedback system is built around an Intel Edison board mounted to the forearm. We also built a companion Android app that is able to control and monitor the temperature with simple voice commands.

We hope that FirstHand can contribute to the ongoing research effort toward humanity's future in space.
